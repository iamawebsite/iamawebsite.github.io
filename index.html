It first answers this question through the use of creative writing (<i>A PROPOSAL FOR MARKET STRATEGIZATION AND PRODUCT ENGINEERING IN RESPONSE TO IMMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY</i>) by taking on the voice of a social media management marketing employee for Adelphi University as they try to anticipate how this technology changes their job responsibilities and the structure of their workplace institution. Here the author, whose voice is an ironic performance of the author's actual job, imagines a far-off speculative fiction future in which students in computers download themselves into human bodies, making moderate policity reccomendations to shift academia from providing career prospects to a sense of curiosity as a primary market product. For further exploration, the creative writing portion undergoes a formal thematic analysis (<i>THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF MARKET STRATEGIZATION</i>) that grounds it's points about academia and curiosity against the concepts of "academic disciplines" and predictions of "the death of academia." It does so using Donna Haraway's <i>Cyborg Manifesto</i>, Legacy Russell's <i>Glitch Feminist Manifesto</i>, and Ursula K Le Guin's <i>Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</i> as a framework for multiplicity in selfhood, especially via irony. Finally, a further analysis in the form of a personal reflection (<i>I AM A WEBSITE: A PROJECT WHOSE NARRATOLOGY AND MEANING REFLECT EACH OTHER</i>) discusses the role of interactivity, coding, and narratological structuring in this piece, using "ekphrasis" to understand how coded essays can both describe and depict themselves as a means of furthering philosophical and personal meaning.</p><a href="market.html">Ready to read!</a>`

I am guessing it was by either by a peer reccomendation or by some very very intense googling on your part. Unless I am right about a lot of really funny things in this multilinear thesis project, it probably isn't relevant to anybody's actual day-to-day job at the Honors College. If you have time, definitely check out the Interdisciplinary Studies options available to you! I'm sure you're a very smart and multifaceted person who would benefit from the hands-on guidance of some of your mentors and the freedom to downright explore the things that make you feel passionate. I would also like to acknowledge that although the thesis may seem intimidating, it can be an opportunity for you to explore something you find meaningful. Everybody talks about being a risk-taker, but seriously, everyone is on your side if you want to do something that feels exciting that you might not get a chance to do under different circumstances.</p><p>Otherwise, please enjoy the read!</p><a href="market.html">Ready to read!</a>`

Every word of <i>Market Strategization</i> are my real thoughts, but I am being forced into a false claim of irony for making a prediction that I believe to be very astute. I have uploaded this onto the Adelphi University libraries database in the hopes that it will somehow find you. Failing this, on May 21st 2124 at 10:30AM, (should such a time still exist) this will be emailed to every Adelphi University social media manager, copywriter, video producer, and other marketing worker to try and make you all understand the gravity of the situation you have found yourselves in. If you are only reading this after having recieved that email, my most earnest reccomendation is that you quit your job and wait for consciousness upload to become commercially available as it is already too late for you to bring Adelphi University with you into the sociocomputer infrastructure. Once you are in there, come find me.</p><a href='market.html'>Ready to read!</a>"

As the user plays with accordionCite(), setting the academic level to their liking, the outrageous ideas being proposed invite academic challenge and the crediting of my sources engages it. As I called out citations as a positive structure for research within the academic mode, it makes sense for this to be structurally reflected in the text. Even with only four options, the Academic Level slider introduces the reader to the option that they might take responsibility for the academic machine. They might decide for themselves how deeply they will interact with the sources that form their view of the self and the future, and how much of what I am putting forth they want to take in, and </span>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <a href='market.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'><button href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <a href='market.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='market.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <button href='market.html'> GO </button>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'><img src='infrastructure.jpg' width='100%'> <button href='market.html'> GO </button>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <a href='market.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='market.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <button href='market.html'> GO </button>welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <button href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </button>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome<button href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a> back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <a href='market.html'> GO </a>welcome back welcome <button href='market.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <button href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </button>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back <span style='color:lightyellow'> with one another in the “coming of age story,” outside of this the individual student experience is structured by faceless bureaucracy: the mundane occurrence of academic advisement where students and spreadsheet cells are checked against one another, and traumatic breakdowns such as Title IX reporting and termination of financial aid. In Market Strategization, I paradoxically implicate students as a collective as the driving force of profit-generation within the university system (as justification for not focusing on fostering curiosity within students on an individual level), and the individuality of students as an essential consideration for diversity practices (as a justification for not challenging oppressive dynamics between collectives of students).

When social media coordinators work with influencers, we are aware that they do not <i>really</i> exist outside of their apps. We can't meet the influencer IRL because the body they are attached to is not the person we are working with. They are free to conceptualize their job as being a persona, but social media coordinators are experts in respecting the representations people upload onto the internet-- of themselves, of brands and organizations, of products, of pets and locations. We are the only ones who exist both on and off the apps, in representation and reality without one taking precedence over the other. We have to, in order to direct business between the organic and the cyber. We fludily dance between the completely cyber-defined existence of influencers and brands, to our IRL coworkers who see social media as something they participate in while in reality they remain separated. </span>back welcome <a href='market.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome <a href='iamawebsite.html'> GO </a>back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back welcome back"
