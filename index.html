    <b><u>A PROPOSAL FOR MARKET STRATEGIZATION AND PRODUCT ENGINEERING IN RESPONSE TO IMMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY</u></b> - <a title= "click me!" href="javascript:norah()">BY NORAH CURRAN</a></h2>

    <p>I have spent my undergraduate senior year working as a social media coordinator for the Adelphi University Honors College. Beginning in my academic third year, I engineered my courseload and undertook <a title= "click me!" href="https://curranmultimedia7.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">several independent research projects</a> on the topic of technoetics, or computer/machine consciousness. The Honors College at Adelphi University, has been an extremely nurturing place for myself, opening me to new perspectives, strengthening my argumentative writing, and supporting my inquiry into questions of the future that might seem at first to be abstract, idealistic, or improbable.</p>

        You're using the accordion citation function! You can increase the academic level to see more context for the ideas raised in this text. Scholars of the digital humanities, technoetics, and science/speculative fiction disciplines offer valuable insights into how developing technologies change our audience. Oftentimes, this is because technology has the ability to fundamentally change how we experience ourselves, the world, or the interface between the two. Take for example, the Internet's re-ontologizing power: an idea found in Luciado Florini’s <i>Ethics After the Information Revolution</i> that explains how the internet changed how we viewed objects in the physical world. Making something like a tree easily "searchable," so that retreiving species, maintenance, and locality information became instantaneous, irrevocably changed the nature of the object in our everyday perceptions. 
    </div>  
            
      
    <p>Come Spring Break, a successor for my position as social media coordinator will be chosen. I have been meditating upon what I can leave for my successors that truly accounts for what I see– given my course of study– as the shaping of our being-ness through social media. </p>
        
    <p>Put simply, my philosophical approach to the Honors College social media platform has been that it is in itself a kind of collective consciousness– a shared memory belonging to no one.. But, as I am writing in 2024, I am certain that very soon the flux state of "the social media platform" itself will accelerate exponentially. 
        
    <p>With the sale of Twitter/X to Elon Musk, we have seen a microcosm of how rapidly the apps themselves can change. These changes will be both highly visible such as the integration of the Grok AI into X, and more subtly cultural such as discourses produced by changes in content moderation standards. We social media coordinators can anticipate that new features will be developed for the apps we call home at a faster and faster rate. To adapt, we will have to focus on our capability to intuit new ways of communication via interface. In 2024, this looks like having a trained eye for trends and memes, such as my "How often does Dr. Carson think of the Roman Empire?" Instagram story. Even a decade from now, it could look unimaginably different. I cannot emphasize this enough: social media coordinators will have to become technologically adaptable beings.</p> 
    
    <p>For this reason, I leave one message for my successors of the social media internship at Adelphi University, which I will expound upon to its furthest extent in this article: <span style= "font-style: italic;"> as soon as it is possible, you must upload yourself, at least in part, into a computer.</span></p> 
    
    <p>I am not advising you to go against your best judgement. In fact, you will see by the end of this essay why following your judgement is a necessity for the mission you are implicated in by accepting your position as social media coordinator. The research of technoetics may be insufficient to prove that your "I", your "being-ness", will be preserved through your transition into computer-or-cyborg embodiment.

            <p> Haraway's <i>A Cyborg Manifesto</i>, a common text in the Adelphi University Honors College, provides more context for how consciousness upload might look for you. </p>
            <p>In it, she writes that physiology has been replaced in the postmodern world with communications engineering. Of this she says, "In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or database construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of fow of a quantity called information." (Haraway 32) </p>
            <p>As a computer embodied individual, you will be given an enormous amount of influence in your role within Adelphi University, as you will be determining not only the rate but the structure of flow of information.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it is possible (and I say quite likely) that the fruits of our labor in the “natural sciences” will be radically changed by our future’s sociocomputer infrastructure. Adelphi University, and other associated conservationist institutions may find little use for the most “scientifically accurate” knowledge of the physical world, given the radical change in concerns that the physical world’s inhabitants will have. Protecting massive physical servers from rainfall, weathering, collapse, earthquake, animal infestation, the world’s natural processes that cannot (yet) be stopped through technological advancement is the task of bio-individuals (or bio-collectives) who remain in the physical world. The maintenance and longevity of life (currently resting in the hands of doctors and nurses who rely upon biological research) is essentially erased by the negation of death through upload and download, re-upload and re-download. In this world, there is a transparent cycle of reincarnation through the technological infrastructure these carbon embodied humans are tasked to maintain. </p> 
        </div>
    
    Then, remaining carbon-embodied is the most wise decision available to you. No one, least of all myself, will fault you for the instinct of self-preservation that distinguishes you as a mortal <a href="javascript:populatePanel(bioIndividualMessage, 'BIO-INDIVIDUAL')">bio-individual.</a> However, you <i>must</i> be open to <i>radical change,</i> even in the structure of your consciousness-- lest you fail to be the technologically adaptable individual best suited for your job at Adelphi.</p> 
    
    <p> If the first human embrace of technoetic consciousness comes from the social media coordinators, the performance of social media presence is no longer enacted by mere users of this technology, but "be-ers" of this technology. This is a concept we do not yet have the word for in 2024. It will be as though every time a new feature is implemented you have a new limb to gesticulate with, <a title= "click me!" href="javascript:paintbox()">a new color to paint with,</a> a new language to speak in.  That which we speak of as “market messaging” will be transmuted, with you, into “market meaning,” and the strategizations you have made will become expressions.</p> 
    
    <p>To my successor who is first faced with the choice of becoming <a href="javascript:populatePanel(transloadedMessage, 'TRANSLOADED')">transloaded</a>, if you anxiously cling to your “humanity” when considering giving up your body to or modifying it with technology I say: <a href="javascript:populatePanel(theCommunicatorMessage, 'THE COMMUNICATOR')">If traditional humanity was your forte,</a> you would not have become a social media coordinator. Ask yourself (you need not tell me): Are you one who listens intently to the voices of those around you, or do you download short bits of information into your brain, like TikToks and Instagram posts? Do you talk to your friends (and think to yourself) in memes? Do you get dressed in the morning without imagining a -core? You, inside, are a container for the people you know and the stories you witness. You have the power to make it so when people see you, they see what is really you– the connections you sow. You can <i>become</i> the digital community you have <i>created,</i> at once have a birds eye view of the land and a soul-tied connection with those who make it up. Take the leap.</p> 
    
    <h3>BEYOND UPLOAD: FURTHER PROGRESS IN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE UNIVERSITY AS AN INSTITUTION</h3>
    
    <p>However, this recommendation carries us only so far. I predict that the technology I speak of will begin to be available only 100 or 200 years into the future. Further advancements and their handling are the responsibility of the techno-beings in my lineage-- another reason that sensible but early adaptation is imperative. The truth of the matter is that past a certain point of human-tech evolution, with cyborg and computer embodied human minds as a norm, the future student body will become inscrutable. For this reason, the next part of this essay will be devoted to how Adelphi University can begin a restructuring in anticipation of evolutionary progress in the field of human consciousness.</p> 
    
    <p>The social media coordinators at Adelphi, having taken on the task of determining when consciousness upload is advanced enough for adaptation in addition to their responsibilities promoting student events, ticket sales, club meetings, and important deadlines for class registration and graduation, will be the alarm for when the work we have undertaken to restructure must spring into action. Their work in cyberspace speaks to prospective students before even the Admissions office, and therefore their knowledge of the student body’s makeup will have the most expedient clarity of all. Ask them, <a title = "click me!" href="javascript:populatePanel(firstTransferMessage, 'THE FIRST CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERS MAY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS: A SPECULATIVE FICTION LOOK AT INSUFFICIENT TECHNOETIC RESEARCH')">in their new uploaded form</a>: Will it not be possible to cut-and-paste, or transfer, or download parts of my “I” into your “I”? More importantly for several Adelphi committees: is it not possible to instantly transfer textbooks, documents, video lectures, podcasts, and other materials into student awareness? Would students be able to remember a state of not-knowing these materials?</p>
    
    <p> If not, which is my prediction– the student body becomes atemporal. Students are now unaware that edits had been made to their repositories through education. Knowledge and awareness happens in a space outside of time, transition, and change. Imagine that the average student does not realize that they had changed at all from their freshman to senior year, because for them it occurred in the snap of a finger– all of their knowledge rendered instantly, all changes installed without a trace of their previous layout.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, our understanding of our past self is not the same as the self-understanding we had at past point in time. Our understanding of our past self is formed by <a title = "click me!" href="javascript:allTheThings(shipOfTheseusMessage, 'THE SHIP OF THESEUS','panel-text')">the very same accumulation of knowledge and experience that changes us from our past self to our present self.</a> For a bio-individual student body, the temporal consciousnesses of maturation, education, and transition is an awareness that a change within ourselves has occurred– this is not necessarily a feature of techno-beings past a certain point. If progress and evolution in the field of human consciousness allows us to surpass our temporal nature by the means outlined in the above paragraph, entire fields of inquiry into the physics and psychology of this phenomenon open. 50 years from now, we should review our spreadsheets in preparation for a wealth of new majors and concentrations that students will want to earn degrees in.</p>
    
    <p>The most rich place for exploration, as well as the most troubled, is the field of education itself. We must make the concept of education and learning relevant to a being whose understanding is fully transferable and needs not to perceive the changes between itself before and after education. As an educational institution, we provide the subject-matter understanding that is necessary for students to work in a given field: this is true of nursing, art, business, psychology, and any other degree field available to our students. “Understanding” is meaningless as a being for whom there is no state of not-understanding, but this does not mean Adelphi University has no place in the world’s technological future. We must simply anticipate the <a title = "click me!" href="javascript:populatePanel(potentiologicalMessage, 'POTENTIOLOGICAL CHALLENGES')">potentiological challenges</a> to our market value that consciousness upload renders upon our collective future, so the institution can remain whole while our student body re-ontologizes in response to these technologies.</p>

       <p> Nicholas Carr’s article in The Atlantic, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” explores the potential for technologies to reshape what “is” through the ontology of thought.

       <p>Due to the relative stability of “the self–” not individual selves, but the nature of what it means to have a self– we do not typically encounter problems caused by re-ontologization of the self. However, when the upload of a human consciousness is possible, the question of basic individuality is immediately problematized. When the body as a physical barrier is left behind, what will there be to distinguish "us" from our environment? To distinguish "me" from you? If "you" and "I" are code-embodied, what quantifiable percentage of difference is there? Will it not be possible to cut-and-paste, or transfer, or download parts of my “I” into your “I”?</p>
        <p>To make this idea less troubling, I turn to Sufi theoretician Farid Ud-Din Attar, author of The Conference of The Birds. This poem explores the journey towards Unity, the realization that everything in the Universe– yourself, the objects in the world, and others– are all reflections of God. Outside of God, there is nothing. Attar writes, “If you see many here or but a few, / They’re one, however they appear to you./The many here are merged in one; one form / Involves the multifarious, thick swarm/(This is the oneness of diversity, Not oneness locked in singularity);” Later in the poem, he writes of a moth who flies into a flame, and realizes the true oneness of itself with the object of its worship through the destruction of its body. The sociocomputer infrastructure is the oneness of which all atemporal techno-beings will be a reflection, and like in Attar’s mystic observations, this will not remove the experience of individual identity but contextualize it against wholeness that is absolutely certain. </p>

        <p>But will it be absolutely certain? Like the birds in Attar’s poems, who are reflections of the One, but begin as unaware of this fact, will atemporal techno-beings who are downloaded into bio-individual bodies experience doubt that they could be a part of something so large and undying? Will the bio-individual body be able to remember the state of their being within the socio-computer infrastructure, or will it feel hypothetical to them until they are re-uploaded? Will concrete evidence of the transcendence of the human mind through technology remove the mystery and doubt of the bio-individual embodiment? </p>
        <p>Conversely, will atemporal techno-beings be able to iterate over the lifetimes they have lived in bio-individual bodies from anything other than a cosmically vast distance? Without the use of neurotransmitters and endorphins, will emotions exist in a state of inaccessibility that mirrors repression until the next download? If it does not know that it has ever been added to and experiences its self-repository as having always already been infinitely large, will the atemporal techno-being be able to form a sense of itself outside of the multiplicitous individualities it has always already embodied? 
        </p>
    </div> 
    
    <p>To further evaluate our market potential in the deep future, we must understand our market reality in the simple present. To motivate students to pay tuition, we provide them with a reasonable expectation that they will have a career in the future that is lucrative enough to pay for their attendance in the past. In order to make this structure self-supporting, our primary product is subject matter understanding, which they use to transition into those careers. When considering the future <a title = "click me!" href = "javascript:populatePanel(studentBodyMessage, 'THE STUDENT BODY')">student body</a>, the necessary temporal element of this market output is troubling to enrollment as we begin to see more atemporal techno-beings in the general population. It is also unclear what careers will be available to atemporal techno-beings, if any.</p>
    
    <p>As we can see, Adelphi University (along with all universities) face a substantial risk of obsolescence in the future if we continue to operate in the way that best serves us in 2024. <a title="click me!" href="javascript:populatePanel(reOntologizeMessage, 'ON RE-ONTOLOGIZATION')">Anticipating this is half the game,</a> as it allows us to prepare to pivot our marketability when the time comes. But innovation, early action– and to be perfectly direct, beginning the transition today– is how we can take advantage of progress in the field of consciousness to propel Adelphi forward among other universities in the deep future.</p>
    
    <p>What can we offer as an educational institution, besides subject matter knowledge and the potential for a career in the future? What do we have to offer that exists at once outside of time, and potentially at all times? I propose a radical change in the service we provide, from rendering understanding onto students, to providing opportunities for curiosity and exploration.</p>
    
    <p>Curiosity exists as an incidental product, a carbon emission, of the current academic system. Our usage of the curiosity we generate is not generally optimized to maximize profit, largely due to its seemingly singular function of motivating students to continue their studies. If the average student was given a binary choice of whether they continue their studies due to a curiosity about the subject matter, or a financial obligation to their present and future self– the realistic and more motivating answer is the financial one. In the shadows and cabballs of the Adelphi University accounting and student retention departments, I hope it is being discussed that higher tuition rates exacerbating sunk cost fallacy is a powerful driver of student retention, and graduation rates which drive student admission, each of which drives our market earning power.</p>
    
    <p>However, in the change to an atemporal student body, curiosity goes from a waste product of academia to a primary marketable resource. By orienting our academic research and engineering programs towards infrastructure for the future student body, we can provide atemporal techno-beings with experiences that are potentiologically threatened along with universities in the technoscape of the deep future. We can become a provider of experience-for-experience and understanding-for-understanding, each of which are aspects of curiosity in their own right. Having laid out the task at hand, I will now propose how Adelphi University may identify itself as a beam of light into a lacking spirit of inquiry in a future society populated by fully atemporal techno-beings: first by considering what the human species stands to lose, and then by re-tooling and re-examining Adelphi’s contemporaneous mission through our anticipation of the deep future.</p>
    
    <h3>REINCARNATION THROUGH THE TECHNO-ARBORETUM: RESTRUCTURING ADELPHI UNIVERSITY FOR THE DEEP FUTURE IN ALIGNMENT WITH CORE VALUES AS STATED AND ENCOUNTERED</h3>
    
    <p>Adelphi University’s physical brand identity is The Oasis. In other words, a teeming spring of biological activity in the midst of a vast and dry expanse. However, attempting to extend this into the deep future reveals that visions of our planet’s ecological unfolding are hardly vast or dry. Rising sea levels and shrinking coastlines provide one of the main existential threats to humanity. Rather than an oasis, this image lends itself more to a small repose of land in the midst of an uncrossable ocean. A desert island. So let us ask: In the deep future, how does Adelphi make an oasis of the desert islands it will be left with?</p>
    <div class="level25">
        <p>In their book <i>The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism</i>, Naomi Klein anticipates the expansion of private markets in response to disasters brought about by climate change. She writes "public infrastructure around the
        world is facing unprecedented stress, with hurricanes, cyclones, floods and
        forest fires all increasing in frequency and intensity. It's easy to imagine a future in which growing numbers of cities have their frail and long-neglected
        infrastructures knocked out by disasters and then are left to rot, their core services never repaired or rehabilitated. The well-off, meanwhile, will withdraw
        into gated communities, their needs met by privatized providers." </p>

        <p>Consider this: rather than the atemporal techno-beings elimination of career as a disasterous reality for our market value, as climate change re-ontologizes the world's infrastructures and class structures, the need for career will be slowly diminished as money is circulated less and less.</p>

        <p>Of course, without the need for careers it is unclear how we will incentivize our engineers to continue work upon the sociocomputer infrastructure. This has revealed a potentiological challenge to the University beyond the scope of this proposal. May I suggest a Committee For Consideration of Potentiological Challenges Re-Ontologizations in the Deep Future?</p> 
    </div> 
    
    <p>However unfortunate, a destruction of the space where carbon-embodied humans can bodily thrive is a massive point in favor of computer-embodiment. Think of it, in a world where consciousness upload is possible, any number of advancements in computer hardware (from nanotechnology to higher storage capacities to simple waterproofing) would allow for a huge amount of personhood to be stored in a limited physical space. With the limits of our biology removed, computer infrastructure that is supportive of human life could be built down to the ocean floor, and skyward into the aether.</p> 
    
    <p>Adelphi’s identification as an oasis is rooted in its 20-year conservation legacy as an arboretum. We are already a place where life forms that struggle to thrive in an environment modified by human touch are kept. Whether that environment is a suburb, or a techno-conscious ocean city, the concept of an arboretum can grow with Adelphi, to meet the demands of both construction of living space and cultivation of life.</p>

        <p>The growth of a tree-- the fare of arboretums-- is a classic educational tool for talking about teleology: the seed pursues its telos of becoming a tree, passing through the transitional stage of saplinghood on its way. Education, for temporal bio-individuals such as the Adelphi students of 2024 is thought of in much the same way. You come in as a freshman, and graduate a senior, passing through sophomore and junior stages along the way. You come in as a child and you leave as an adult. You come in uneducated and you leave educated.</p>

        <p>The growth of a tree-- the fare of arboretums-- is a classic educational tool for talking about teleology: the seed pursues its telos of becoming a tree, passing through the transitional stage of saplinghood on its way. Education, for temporal bio-individuals such as the Adelphi students of 2024 is thought of in much the same way. You come in as a freshman, and graduate a senior, passing through sophomore and junior stages along the way. You come in as a child and you leave as an adult. You come in uneducated and you leave educated.</p>
        <p>In this sense, the arboretum is a spiritual identity for the University. We house "tree students" and oversee their growth in an environment of harsh economic drought. Perhaps it is comforting to my readers to realize that the boundary between student and object is blurry long before students are uploading themselves into computers. And, for our financiers, this is another form of conservation! We will not need to pay for a rebrand away from our branding as the nature sanctuary of Garden City and into the technosphere.</p>
    </div> 
    
    <p>Our identity as an arboretum is not just a legal status, but a core part of the student body experience at Adelphi. The trees sanctuated at Adelphi sustain lives,  both through their oxygen and their beauty. Sadly, both breathing and admiring are two sensory experiences that will be lost along with the human body, even if we approximate it with fans and cameras, in the shift to computer embodiment...</p> 
    
    <p>...Unless some institution were to step in to preserve the human body through ecological adversity. Some institution that was positioned as both conservationists of biological life and cultivators of examined, educational, humanistic lives. As I have already pointed out, Adelphi is extremely well-suited to the mission that this future world orients us towards.</p> 
    
    <p>In addition to its conservation efforts, Adelphi University has also mounted itself in defense of the perceived reality of its students. Mere sustenance of human biological life would not, in itself, procure curiosity as a market product. In truth, perceived reality is a much denser concept than we may give it credit for in 2024, and that which it takes for granted is highly betraying what we may lose in ourselves in service of progressing human consciousness.</p>
    
    <p>We defend our student’s right to their perceived reality, in line with our stated core value of “respect for the individual,” through our robust array of clubs. Allowing student clubs to exist organizes the individuals whom we shepherd through the educational system into something larger than themselves– so whether one’s identity is as a “Young Democratic Socialist,” a “Young Republican,” a “Future Teacher,” a “For Justice in Palestine,” or a “Girl Who Codes,” there is a perceived reality of what Adelphi is carved out for them in these student spaces.</p> 
        
    <p>In this regard, Adelphi University is an underrecognized innovator in the field of analog virtual reality; wherever students “log on” their reality will be virtually as unchallenging to them as an individual as possible, so long as easing a challenging environment for one student does not require challenging other students. Of course, we are helpless in the limitations that individuality confers upon the present student body– and as such, we have found that it is completely impossible to act decisively upon social issues except for when students threaten to offer a legitimate challenge to people's percieved realities. What can we know about perceived reality as a marketable product, and how does it relate to the larger mission of reorienting Adelphi University towards providing curiosity for the future student body, as soon as those students are primarily atemporal?</p>
    
    <p>The key difference between the bio-individuals we currently educate and an atemporal techno-being is that the latter can have multiple experiences and understandings of itself that have happened at once. It will feel each of them to be fully its own experience, with no experience that one of those self-understandings existed within itself before the others. By downloading into a body that can inquire into, but not experience, other people's perspectives, the atemporal techno-being begins drawing lines of difference and change through what it already knows itself to be. Think of the wealth of experience available to the atemporal being who becomes bio-individual for some time! Maturity, having one's perspective changed, ignorance, revelation, gender transition, amputation, the One Stop Financial Aid Office... Whether the time spent is one hour, one month, one year, or one human lifetime (What difference would it make to an atemporal being?) the experiences of becoming and understanding will propel these beings towards higher inquiry. It will cause them to keep downloading themselves, keep re-enrolling in Adelphi University.</p>
    
    <p>In the deep future, Adelphi University will allow atemporal technologically embodied consciousnesses to download themselves into ethically lab-grown, bio-individual bodies, in order to bodily experience young adulthood in a university environment suited towards developing their perceived realities. This is the techno-arboretum that Adelphi University will restructure to by the arrival of the deep future.  As consciousness upload will remove the issue of individuality within the student body through 1:1 transfer of firsthand experience, it will become a form of <a href ="javascript:populatePanel(comingOfAgeMessage, 'COMING OF AGE TRANSLATED TO THE ATEMPORAL TECHNO-BEING')">“coming of age”</a> for atemporal beings to experience several temporal bio-individual lifetimes to share between other atemporal computer-embodied beings. The driving force of this <a title = "click me!" href= "javascript: populatePanel(sociocomputerMessage, 'THE SOCIOCOMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE')"> sociocomputer infrastructure</a> will be curiosity, compelling  further transfer  of information gained in the techno-arboretum between atemporal-beings, allowing for an infinite and immortal outward expansion of student’s education.</p>
    
    <p>In order to actualize this techno-arboretum technology in time to occupy the deep future market, certain changes should be made now in order to prime for the shift towards providing students with opportunities for exploring their curiosity. Although we continue to serve mere bio-individuals in 2024, these shifts are meant to prime our faculty for the matriculation of our first classes of atemporal techno-beings. In order to foster student curiosity, I recommend: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Going by faculty recommendation to create policies for compensation, time off, class scheduling and modality, and grading that allows faculty to maintain a passionate engagement with their field of expertise.</li>
      <li>Easing the financial burden upon students wherever possible, so that their terms of engagement with their subject matter remains based on their own passionate engagement rather than their indebtedness to the university.</li>
      <li>Leaving ample room in class schedules for extracurriculars and electives so students may discover more genuine  interests and increase connectivity between subject areas.</li>
      <li>Develop hiring, professional development, and student conduct practices that practice meaningful awareness and change for students experiencing threats of eradication in the complex political spheres.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Of course, each of these recommendations are to be undertaken with the most stringent eye towards their financial viability, always keeping in mind that these changes are to make Adelphi University a more lucrative and relevant market force in the deep future, given the inevitability of atemporal consciousness as a result of technological progress. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF <i>MARKET STRATEGIZATION</i></h3>
    <p style="text-indent:0%;"><u>THEME ONE: MULTIPLE SELVES, OF AND WITHIN ACADEMIA</u></p>
	<p>Throughout the Market Strategization text, the questions I am interested in pursuing surround the “self,” with the centralizing question of “How would the ability to fully upload one’s self into a computer change what it means to be a self?” Beginning with the self-as-self, the recommendation to social media coordinators like myself that we change our mode of embodiment and radically alter our self-experience in service of our jobs, I am exploring what radical self-alteration could feel like from a first-person perspective. Later, as I make recommendations to restructure Adelphi University, I interact with the self-in-context by attempting to retool a commonplace institution whose mission is explicitly tied to the individual and their implied “self.”</p>
	<p>In the Market Strategization text, the atemporal techno-being to which the social media coordinator (and later the student body at large) transloads into is a radical re-ontologizing of “selfhood” that disrupts the potential for the university system to reproduce itself in the future. While university education and the narrative of the individual are productively engaged with one another in the “coming of age story,” outside of this the individual student experience is structured by faceless bureaucracy: the mundane occurrence of academic advisement where students and spreadsheet cells are checked against one another, and traumatic breakdowns such as Title IX reporting and termination of financial aid. In Market Strategization, I paradoxically implicate students as a collective as the driving force of profit-generation within the university system (as justification for not focusing on fostering curiosity within students on an individual level), and the individuality of students as an essential consideration for diversity practices (as a justification for not challenging oppressive dynamics between collectives of students). Market Strategization as a whole is an ironic attempt to think through a university’s re-negotiation of its selfhood under radical technological change, using branding and marketing strategy as a life preserver in the deep end of potentiological challenges to its existence.  It is a sendup of the “seven year plan,” which already fails to anticipate radical shifts in ed-tech. It imagines a “seven thousand year plan” that overshoots a reasonable range of market speculation, attempting to outpace the innovations that outpace us. </p>
    <p>“The self” exists on several levels in Market Strategization text as a vehicle for reimagining the structures that produce it into structures that would allow it to grow beyond itself. The social media coordinator’s radical self-alteration allows it to become a social media cyborg whose awareness rapidly expands along with every update to its means of communication. The atemporal techno-being as a revolutionary change to selfhood forces social institutions that depend on individuals to change their structures in response. The self of the university anxiously ruminates on escaping its own destruction as the conditions for its student body crumble into the future. The self is the thing that cannot be eradicated through anything but complete destruction, and so extracts growth out of unrecognizability to sustain itself into the future. Extracting growth out of unrecognizability is my expansion upon Luciano Floridi’s “re-ontologization” introduced in Ethics After the Information Revolution.Floridi observes the potential of technology to radically reconstruct the being of objects, his examples being a company, machine, or “some artefact.” In my writing I use re-ontologization as an undertaking by which a self finds either new physical containers for its selfhood, or conceptual containers (that are often built via the embrace of multiplicity); resisting the eradication of becoming unrecognizable within contexts changed by innovation. </p>
    <p>The Glitch Feminist Manifesto by Legacy Russell introduces a glitch-self that extracts growth out of unrecognizability by its refusal to be flattened by systems of representation that do not make legible the wholeness of its being. As a whole, Russell speaks of bodies that inhabit multiple oppressed identities– especially Black femmes– as examples of “glitches” in systems of identity definition, formation, and categorization. The multiplicity of these bodies’ identities disrupt the programming that structures conversation around identity groups that look to define the “Black experience” or the “femme experience” and its conditions for existence as discrete. The inadequacy of this definitional programming produces a “flattening” effect for multiplicitous bodies, resigning their identity to the ineffable, unable to ever be talked about in full– and therefore only knowable on a level of mere reference. However, Russell’s “Glitch Feminism” advocates for positively identifying with multiplicity as a means of disrupting systems of representation whose inadequacy is entangled with oppression. Russell writes, “E. Jane’s naming and claiming of ‘multiple selves’ pushes back against a flattened reading of historically othered bodies… To seize ‘multiple selves’ is, therefore, an inherently feminist act: multiplicity is a liberty.” (Russell 22-23). Here, Russell puts forth a mechanism of self-definition that extracts growth out of unrecognizability– bodies whose identities could otherwise only become flattened and unrecognizable within inadequate-oppressive programs of identity definition, will instead grow out of and around these programs into something recognizable, but no longer confined to pre-emptive definition. </p>
    <p>While Russel writes to the theme of identity, oppression, and liberation in society at large, I see connections between their structural observations in Glitch Feminism and the structures in academia, which my work grows out of and around. I am not claiming that the interdisciplinary studies are an oppressed identity group, only that Russell’s understanding of oppression through flattening definition is applicable to the academic institution of disciplinarity. The “interdisciplinary studies” are recognized in reference only by the system of definition for scholarly identity– academic disciplinarity. The structuring of disciplines and their associated academic trajectories is ultimately artificial, which is obviously not to say they are worthless or arbitrary, just that the progression from freshman to senior to graduate in any discipline is constructed within universities and not handed down from the sky. While the recognition and allowance for students to build their own majors in the Interdisciplinary Studies department is an outward embrace of, and investment in, multiplicity for students from the University– multiplicity is ultimately flattened into unrecognizability by the disciplinary structure. Sequestering of “the embrace of multiplicity in academia” to a singular department makes the specific areas of study designed under this name unrecognizable, but only in view of the programming that allows Mathematics, Exercise Science, Communications, Business Management, (and of course the close to my heart English, Computer Science, and Philosophy) to be recognized as discrete degree categories.</p>
    <p>The embrace of “glitch” identity for interdisciplinary academics offers one solution to the issue of representability. Certainly, it solidly illustrates the interdisciplinary academics’ current position as an embodied disruption of disciplinary structures. However, the standpoint of “interdisciplinary studies” is to the contemporaneous moment an interwoven thread of a potential future which the present could unravel into entirely. In the next section we will explore the “death of academia,” but we need not know why academia is apparently dying to see the issue it poses for the solution I extract from Russell’s writing: if the system we are a “glitch” of dies, does our ability to see ourselves not die with it? To solve this problem in the third section, we turn to Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto. </p>

    <p style="text-indent:0%;"><u>THEME TWO: THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION AND ITS RESTRUCTURING </u></p>
    <p>Chad Orzel’s 2022 article, “Imminent Death of the Academy Predicted,” reflects upon several growing issues in academic institutions that are lowering student enrollment. Among other points, his view is that there is some truth to the idea that you can teach yourself almost anything now using the Internet, but that academic institutions provide the structure most people require to actually attain mastery while slogging through basic material. In making this point, Orzel is focused on the academic institution’s ability to confer technical knowledge onto students. In Market Strategization, I specifically call out a shift from conferring subject matter expertise to imbuing students with a sense of sustained curiosity and passion for learning in itself. So, what is the Internet’s role in engaging people’s curiosity? </p>
    <p>My explanation is that as people embraced learning from YouTube tutorials, free library archives, blog posts, knowledge is no longer “passed down” through the uneven relationship between student and teacher, but is “passed along” between faceless individuals. Even if one were to say that social media removes the “facelessness” of tutorial makers and blog posters, I would argue that it also unmasks the excellence within a multitude of average, non-academic individuals. There is an ocean of free educational material on the Internet, and without a predetermined “degree trajectory” to follow, learners can accumulate knowledge rapidly, with a high degree of specification, and without an unavoidable endpoint (graduation). While op-eds (and department chairs) wonder if the “death of academia” is imminent, it is clear that intellectual curiosity itself is not what is dying, but I would argue that its place in authoritatively structuring academic institutions has multiplicitous feet in infinitely as many graves. The Internet has given people a place where their desire to learn is not flattened by disciplinarity, slowed by externally-determined pacing and trajectory, terrorized by financial burden, or humiliated through unequal power structures with poor mechanisms to protect students’ dignity. </p>
    <p>In Market Strategization, the concept of uploading oneself into a computer takes what the Internet has provided to the nth degree. The “atemporal techno-being” has no experience of time, and therefore no need for “graduation.” The ability to transfer the experiences of others into oneself makes power imbalance difficult to sustain. Infinite lifetimes through download and reupload into the sociocomputer infrastructure generates infinite interdisciplinary connections to be made between lifetimes. Without certainty of what kind of career an atemporal techno-being could have, financial burden becomes entirely opaque. That which is made unrecognizable within the current operations of academic institutions is reified into an actual body. The idea in Market Strategization that we are not currently offering students opportunities to cultivate curiosity and passionate engagement with learning because of the nature of the human body is facetious. </p>
    <p>By framing this argument in terms of branding, profitability, and income through student retention, I am pointing towards the actual tension between the market value and sustainability of an institution and the ideals it represents. The result is that students who want to be passionately engaged with learning are flattened by bureaucracy, financial burden, and power imbalance. On the surface, I offer the fundamental re-ontologizing of the human body as a possible reason that academic institutions would shift to focus on cultivating curiosity. This far off (possibly unattainable) goalpost for institutionally structuring ourselves to provide students with a passion for learning is a way of asking: What are we actually waiting for, if not something so radical? </p>

    <p style="text-indent:0%;"><u>THEME THREE: THE SHIFT TOWARDS CURIOSITY</u></p>

    <p>In Market Strategization, as I construct a re-ontologization of the human body to interrogate the university’s relationship to students, the university strives to avoid its own death by obsolescence. This is a response to the “death of academia” take from the perspective of the university, which when faced with complete eradication even in the deep future, finally realizes and acts upon its own changeability. But given that Market Strategization is a work of satire and speculative fiction, what can actually be said about shifting from subject matter expertise to curiosity and passionate engagement for the academic institution? </p>
    <p>Russell has provided us with convincing context for an antagonistic dualism between the disciplines and interdisciplinary studies, but Haraway’s cyborg provides a structure to move beyond the antagonistic dualism between the academic institution and the rest of the world. While Russell’s Glitch Feminist Manifesto seeks to affirmatively pronounce flattened identities through the “glitch,” Haraway’s integration of the machinic into the organic leaves “true” identity unpronounced. Rather, she advocates for responsibility over the mechanisms that define our embodiment in terms of identity without attempting to integrate into a mythic singular self. 
    <p>Of the problem at hand, she writes:</p>
    <p class="block-quote">To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals—in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self..  The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many. (Haraway 59)</p>

	<p>The dialectical domination by the One of the other through mirroring of “the self” is present on several levels throughout the academic institutional structure. In Market Strategization, academia is trapped in a struggle with the multiplicity of its identity that embodies the idea that “One is too few, but two are too many.” The capitalist bureaucracy that houses disciplinarity and calls itself academia is the One, which curiosity and passionate engagement must mirror itself after in order to move through the structure and graduate. The proxy of this war within academia’s self-concept is “the student body,” where I pun off of the colloquial phrase for “the collection of students within a university”, to mean the literal embodiment of students within either human (bio-individual) or computer (atemporal techno-being) bodies. The experience of the student body is structured by academic “discipline-” a word that in itself invokes domination– which serves the purpose of setting quantifiable amounts of time and money owed to the institution in order to leave. At the same time the future of academia is held by the student body. To secure the tuition payments of future students, the future student body must be anticipated in terms of what will ensure their future “submission” of applications to the university, sustaining enrollment and retention rates. To sustain the student body, academia promises individual students the ability to sustain themselves through employment after graduation. What Market Strategization aims to show is that if technological innovation were to re-ontologize the human body to remove the need for employment or disrupt individuality altogether, academia would be forced to respond with its own radical restructuring in order to continue dominating the student body by which it survives.  </p>
    <p>As atemporal techno-beings have no need for employment or bodily sustenance, the marketing in Market Strategization is only able to frame the re-ontologization of Adelphi University in terms of maintaining relevance to the student body. This forces a shift in the self of academia from subject matter expertise and its entanglement with capitalism, to the fostering of curiosity and passionate engagement beyond profit. This is not because I think wide scale consciousness upload is necessarily an unmonetizable cultural revolution, but rather to hint at a world where academia and the student body exist in a non-hierarchical relationship.</p>
    <p>The solution Donna Haraway offers is the cyborg body: </p>
    <p class="block-quote">“A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. (Haraway 65)</p>
    <p> While people are going to the Internet to pace their own education, an exodus from the academic institution also abandons structures that genuinely benefit research which universities help to uphold. A concrete example is citations: helpful for clarifying the threads a larger argument is woven out of, making echo chambers clear, crediting discoveries to the context they are born of, and guiding future researchers towards more sources related to their topic. As education is expanded out and around academia into the space of the Internet, there is no reason that such beneficial parts of the machine should be abandoned. In fact, doing so is arguably detrimental in its ability to create discourses that use a flattened form of academic engagement and do not take responsibility for the machine as a whole. </p>
    <p>The cyborg solution I extract from Haraway’s writing envisions academia as a mode that is fused into oneself through the use of its structures for research and engagement, but absent of financial burden or domination by external predetermination of one’s academic trajectory. The academic mode orients the self towards an uncertain, unrecognizable future (i.e. one that is not predetermined); enabling the self to extract both personal and societal growth via curiosity and passionate engagement. The academic mode is a seamless extension of machinic process fused to the organic self, that allows curiosity to be named, claimed, and contextualized through research without seeking to be unitarily defined by external discipline. The organic self continuously feeds into the academic mode via its curiosity, with neither expecting that the organic self will be depleted and totalized into a unitarily academic self. The fusing of the academic mode with the organic self opens up the possibility for continuous disruption of domination/flattening by systems of definition as definition becomes itself an object of research. The academic mode seeks definitions that can be assembled into the self without totalization. </p>
    <p>As more information and definition is gathered in the disassembly and reassembly of the self, the organic self becomes a thoroughfare for connections between what has been gathered. This is the “interdisciplinary” re-ontologized. As the academic mode has been liberated from the academic institution, all discipline becomes interdisciplinary in the absence of artificial boundaries between Mathematics, Exercise Science, Communications, Business Management, and the close to my heart English, Computer Science, and Philosophy. The context of discovery no longer needs to be a thing-in-itself (a discipline) and so can exist as a form of citation, a necessary attachment to the use of information that does not dominate people through predetermination. </p>
    <p>The “death of academia” does not need to happen for the academic mode to be harmonized through cyborgification with the organic self. Nor would it singularly bring about this cyborgification if academic institutions were to die. The demand for marketability has an effect on academia that is both flattening per Russell, and mirroring of the One within the other per Haraway, ultimately fraying the curiosity aspect of the institutional self into unrecognizability.  Nonetheless, academia has birthed useful structures for education, produced great minds, and given many people (myself included) the opportunity for passionate engagement with their own curiosity already. As I write, the “death of academia” is not something I advocate for, but a conceptual exercise to reveal what the life of academia has added to the world, and how the academic spirit can live on through radical reconstructions of thought, technology, and selfhood, resisting total eradication through a responsive re-ontologization. Haraway’s cyborg adds the understanding that this re-ontologization will not come singularly from “academia” or “the student body,” but is a continuous happening within the cybernetic entangling of both groups. There can be no temporal or locational beginning of this cyborg. There is only generation of becoming for something that does not use itself to seek either wholeness or end. </p>

message2="woof woof woof woof woof"

theCommunicatorMessage = "Before the invention of consciousness upload, The Communicator was always an object. It was the switchboard used by telephone operators. It was the postal worker’s bag. It was the clay tablet that would be soaked in water and re-pressed with new writing. The Communicator is defined by its transient self, its ability to write and rewrite, to hold multiple perspectives and somehow, somehow, seamlessly integrate each new perspective into itself, over and over again unto eternity. When humans and objects come together in uploaded consciousness, The First Human Communicator appears (at Adelphi University.)"

bioIndividualMessage = "Bio-individual, a term coined for this text, is the synthesis of biological embodiment and individual perspective within a given being. Although it is highly likely that this will be applicable to cyborg and robot bodies eventually, within this text it is used exclusively to refer to a human born human being (aka a cisloaded human being) without cybernetic augmentation. A term such as bio-individual becomes necessary when comparing the world-perception of a cisloaded human or transloaded computer with a transloaded human or cisloaded computer; the experience of time and mortality are so different as to reorganize 'beingness' for each being."

transloadedMessage= "Transloaded, a term coined for this text, refers to a being that has undergone a chance in consciousness embodiment to go from carbon embodied or vice-versa. For example, a human-born-human-being who uploads themself into a computer is transloaded. The counterpoint for this word is cisloaded."

shipOfTheseusMessage = "As the ship of Theseus continued to be held in the Greek harbors, slowly over time, every sail and scrap of wood continued to be replaced until not one inch of the boat had been seen or touched by Theseus himself. Is it the same boat? This same question can be asked of our 'selves' to varying degrees of distressing-ness over any period of time. Am I the same me as at breakfast? When I was seven? If I switched political parties and have a drastically different worldview, am I the same person? Are you the same as when you started reading this? This question, I imagine, will have a major moment of vogue when consciousness-upload first becomes possible-- which isn't to say that it isn't already. Perhaps what I mean is known as possible to the public consciousness."

firstTransferMessage = "People who felt sick and unsatisfied, nauseated by the circumstances of their lives– so long as they had enough money to invest in experimental technology– were signing up for a moment on the public stage as literal guinea pigs of the first consciousness transfers. They were to have their conscious experiences transferred into the lab-grown, un-ensouled bodies of guinea pigs. It was popularized as a way of escaping the stresses of young adult human life: who, really, wouldn’t choose to be a guinea pig given the chance? Isn’t it much simpler that way? However, test subjects reported higher levels of shock and disbelief than scientists predicted. After the experiment was completed it was explained to them (in their human bodies) that yes, their consciousness had been transferred to the guinea pig: but, in their body was now a consciousness focused on remembering the past, completing their assigned tasks, socializing and eating and exercising the appropriate amount, and surviving until death. The scientists later found that the guinea pig where their consciousnesses were stored was now very anxious about whether the water bottle would remain full, whether their cages appeared trendy. Some even engaged in behavior deemed “coatmaxxing,” using materials available to them to change the color of their coat (which had been selected arbitrarily) to one that was of a broader appeal, clear by way of trends in guinea-pig consciousnesses over a period of months to be white, then calico, then black, then calico again. If this is the reality of consciousness upload, the bio-individual social media coordinator should remain cisloaded in their original body."

studentBodyMessage="The student body is our responsibility, therefore the primary source of our problems, both now and in the future. Because in 2024, the student body is entirely a bio-individual one, we are forced to design our institution around the realities of death, feeding and housing, and individual identity. Budget that could go towards more leadership committees is going towards student healthcare. We prepare students to feed and house their fragile bodies throughout their lifetimes, wasting money away on career services, dining services, residence hall maintenance and safety… and this is not to mention the Student Engagement budget, set aside to “help” students “find a common identity” among their peers and “self-actualize,” a tragedy of finance entangled completely with the demand that students be treated as individuals, an illusory state of the bio-individual student body. As the average student body changes from bio-individual to atemporal techno-being, our budget can be re-invigorated in support of what really matters– decision making. Right now, Adelphi University has only a pithy 49 committees making our decisions about Animal Rights, Student Activities, LGBTQ and Allies, etc. Imagine how many committees could exist in the future when students are largely freed from their bodily needs!"

potentiologicalMessage = "As a budding marketing professional, I agree that opaque terminology and pretentious intellectualisms that require professionals to think about their meaning get in the way of talking fast enough to make things happen at the most optimized rate. Please, forgive me for my transgression here– I would not use such a word unless it were absolutely necessary– and I will have been punished enough in the loss of valuable readers who do not tolerate vocabulary enough to read this far. In truth, the meaning is simple. A potentiological challenge is an existential threat to an institution (in this case academia) that requires stable outside circumstances so that it remains possible for the institution to exist. The solution to a potentiological challenge are creative adaptations to changing circumstances that allow most of the institutional structure to exist, while changing only what must be changed in order to survive. Climate change poses a potentiological challenge to academia by threatening the land that it exists upon. A viable solution to this potentiological challenge is transitioning universities onto barges or boats to float above the water, or an Atlantis style underwater campus to continue operations below water. When market strategizing in the deep future, potentiological challenges and their solutions are often threats to aspects of an institution that are taken deeply for granted: in this case, the nature of the student body. To further explore the relevance of the student body to Adelphi University, open “THE STUDENT BODY.”"

reOntologizeMessage = "While more context is provided for what re-ontologization is, and how it relates to emerging consciousness upload technologies, via an academic citation– here I would like to illustrate other re-ontologizations that could affect the structuring of Adelphi University. If dolphins or octopi develop the means to communicate with the human world as intelligent beings, the resulting civil rights battle could re-ontologize the essence of world citizenship to also serve aquatic beings. Ironically this could also be solved through barge or Atlantis Universities, but other solutions such as building complex canal systems or a separate underwater campus are also viable. Actually, has anyone thought of a proposal for market strategization and product engineering in response to aquatic domination? As a note for readers in the interim of 2024 and wide scale consciousness upload, further research into water preparedness appears to be a necessity if we are to prevent the death or slowdown of university processes."

comingOfAgeMessage = "It may be helpful to consider that once temporality becomes irrelevant, there is nowhere for the techno-being to grow but outward. It can only become bigger, more diverse, and crucially it is the responsibility we have as a university to this conscious being's becoming that we must respond to. The future of human consciousness is unlike the trees and the individuals we are caretakers for in 2024. To maintain our bare minimum Diversity, Equity and Inclusion standards across the genesis of new forms of consciousness, we must reconsider what the true purpose of the 'university' structure is, to befit all kinds of conscious experience. The techno-arboretum technology I have hereby proposed is a translation of Adelphi's role in bio-individual self-actualization, consisting of providing knowledge and ways of thinking that generate more learning, into the same role in an atemporal techno-being's self-embodiment. Unlike bio-individuals, the ways of thinking for techno-beings are in themselves the multiplicity of bio-individual perceived realities collected and animated in a techno-being that can never be bigger or smaller than its contents. As consciousnesses and perceived realities are transferred between techno-beings, they grow outwards to a fuller self-embodiment."

sociocomputerMessage = "The means to constructing this technology, which forms the background of the techno–arboretum technology, will be slowly revealed as the present melts into the future. While we may not be able to anticipate the science behind building a technology that houses the whole of humanity in bodies that do not experience time or change, we can certainly imagine its importance in responding to potentiological threats to humanity such as climate change. It will be as fundamental to our civilization as cities, roads, and waterways by the year 2424."

officeHoursMessage = "If you're reading this, did it work? My ultimate goal is for this link to temporarily (as far as your body can tell) upload your consciousness into an atemporal communion with mine-- which I hope can both exist infinitely for discussions with my readers, and infinitely in pursuit of curiosity about being-ness and cognition. It will seem as though clicking this link psychically gave you the feeling of just having woken up from a dream whose events and meaning are slipping away from you. Should our carbon-embodied/bio-individual bodies exist simultaneously, whether in the techno-arboretum or my natural lifetime, the next time you see me I will be speaking a language you do not remember learning but somehow understand; we have learned it in our time together. If I will not see you 'in person--' what a new meaning that phrase has-- you will remember this text having always been a letter arguing for the genesis of consciousness-upload and construction of techno-arboretums, rather than the generic portfolio website it appears as to the cisloaded bio-individual."
